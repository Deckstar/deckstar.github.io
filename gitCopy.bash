# HOW TO USE:
#
# PSEUDO-CODE TEMPLATE:
# ```
# bash ./gitCopy.bash {fileToCopy} {...newFiles}
# ```
#
# EXAMPLE:
# Lets say you have a file called Section.tsx. Your section has grown very big
# and you want to split it into into three subsection files, while preserving
# the git history. Your plan is to copy the section file into three new files, in
# a new subfolder called "subsections".
#
# In that case, you would do something like this:
#
# ```
# bash ./gitCopy.bash ./components/Section.tsx ./components/subsections/Section1.tsx ./components/subsections/Section3.tsx ./components/subsections/Section3.tsx
# ```
